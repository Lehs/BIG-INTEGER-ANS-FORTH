# BIG-INTEGER-ANS-FORTH
For more than a year ago I started to define words for arithmetics on arbitrary number strings (ascii). I terrorized people at various sites with my questions and solutions and got a lot of feedback. Then I changed from ascii strings with most significant numbers in lowmem to "cellimal" system with least significant cells in lowmem. By now, it is a rather fast and general system working in Forth style, with a stack for arithmetics and a second stack for storing data. Almost all the words are very similar to the words for other kind of calculations in Forth. Tested on:

32 bit SP-Forth on Vista and Windows 10; 
32 bit GForth on Vista, Windows 10 and Android; 
32 bit SwiftForth on Vista and Windows 10; 
32 bit Win32Forth on Vista and Windows 10;
64 bit GForth and GForth-fast on Windows 10; 
32 bit Gforth and GForth-fast on Linux; 
64 bit Gforth and GForth-fast on Linux.
